| 1       | EN/UVLO | I   | Enable input and undervoltage lockout programming pin. If the EN/UVLO voltage is below 0.4 V, the controller is in shutdown mode with all functions disabled. If the EN/UVLO voltage is greater than 0.4 V and less than 1.2 V, the regulator is in standby mode with the VCC regulator operational, the SS pin grounded, and no switching at the HO and LO outputs. If the EN/UVLO voltage is above 1.2 V, the SS/TRK voltage can ramp and pulse-width modulated gate-drive signals are delivered to the HO and LO pins. A 10-uA current source is enabled when EN/UVLO exceeds 1.2 V and flows through the external UVLO resistor divider to provide hysteresis. Hysteresis can be adjusted by varying the resistance of the external divider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2       | RT      | I   | Oscillator frequency adjust pin. The internal oscillator is programmed with a single resistor between RT and the AGND. TI recommends a maximum oscillator frequency of 1 MHz. An RT pin resistor is required even when using the SYNCIN pin to synchronize to an external clock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3       | SS/TRK  | I   | Soft start and voltage-tracking pin. An external capacitor and an internal 10-uA current source set the ramp rate of the error amplifier reference during start-up. When the SS/TRK pin voltage is less than 0.8 V, the SS/TRK voltage controls the noninverting input of the error amp. When the SS/TRK voltage exceeds 0.8 V, the amplifier is controlled by the internal 0.8-V reference. SS/TRK is discharged to ground during standby and fault conditions. After start-up, the SS/TRK voltage is clamped 115 mV above the FB pin voltage. If FB falls due to a load fault, SS/TRK is discharged to a level 115 mV above FB to provide a controlled recovery when the fault is removed. Voltage tracking can be implemented by connecting a low impedance reference between 0 V and 0.8 V to the SS/TRK pin. The 10-uA SS/TRK charging current flows into the reference and produces a voltage error if the impedance is not low. Connect a minimum capacitance from SS/TRK to AGND of 2.2 nF. |

| 7       | SYNCOUT | O   | Synchronization output. Logic output that provides a clock signal that is 180° out-of-phase with the high-side FET gate drive. Connect SYNCOUT of the master LM5146 to the SYNCIN pin of a second LM5146 to operate two controllers at the same frequency with 180° interleaved high-side FET switch turn-on transitions. Note that the SYNCOUT pin does not provide 180° interleaving when the controller is operating from an external clock that is different from the free-running frequency set by the RT resistor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 8       | SYNCIN  | I   | Dual function pin to provide an optional clock input and enable diode emulation by the low-side MOSFET. Connecting a clock signal to the SYNClN pin synchronizes switching to the external clock. Diode emulation by the low-side MOSFET is disabled when the controller is synchronized to an external clock, and negative inductor current can flow in the low-side MOSFET with light loads. A continuous logic low state at the SYNCIN pin enables diode emulation to prevent reverse current flow in the inductor. Diode emulation results in discontinuous mode operation (DCM) at light loads, which improves efficiency. A logic high state at the SYNCIN pin disables diode emulation, producing forced-PWM (FPWM) operation. During soft start when SYNCIN is high or a clock signal is present, the LM5146 operates in diode emulation mode until the output is in regulation, then gradually increases the SW zero-cross threshold, resulting in a gradual transition from DCM to FPWM.  |
